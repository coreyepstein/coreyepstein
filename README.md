**Corey Epstein** — founder, builder, person who taught AI agents to do his job so he could do more of it.

I build systems where humans set direction and AI does the heavy lifting. Not chatbots. Not wrappers. Full autonomous workflows that ship real code, manage real operations, and run real businesses.

### What I'm building

**[HQ](https://github.com/coreyepstein/hq-starter-kit)** — A personal OS for orchestrating work with AI agents. 30+ workers, 22 commands, multi-company operations. One terminal.

**[Ralph Methodology](https://github.com/coreyepstein/ralph-methodology)** — An autonomous AI development loop. Write a PRD. Go to sleep. Wake up to working software. Named after Ralph Wiggum because the best systems are the ones simple enough that even Ralph could run them.

**[MCP Servers](https://github.com/coreyepstein/advanced-gmail-mcp)** — Tools that give Claude Code real capabilities: [Gmail](https://github.com/coreyepstein/advanced-gmail-mcp) and [Slack](https://github.com/coreyepstein/advanced-slack-mcp) integrations for multi-account management.

**[Mr. Burns](https://github.com/coreyepstein/mr-burns)** — PRD-driven autonomous coding agent. Feed it user stories, it executes them with Claude Code. The nuclear option for shipping fast.
